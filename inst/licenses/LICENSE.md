## Note on World Bank Open Data API and Nager.Date API

The `MexicoDataAPI` package depends on two public RESTful APIs for accessing Mexican and global data:

1. **World Bank Open Data API**

The **World Bank Open Data API** is a RESTful web service that provides access to a vast collection of international development indicators. It allows for real-time retrieval of economic, social, and environmental data, including metrics such as GDP, population, education, and poverty levels.

This API is publicly accessible, requires **no authentication**, and returns results in either **JSON** or **XML** format. It supports filtering by country, indicator code, and year. It is widely used in data science, research, and educational contexts.

In the `MexicoDataAPI` package, the API is used to **dynamically retrieve and display real-time indicators for Mexico**. 
Data is accessed live via HTTP requests to the API and shown directly in the R console. **No data is stored or redistributed** by this package.

2. **API: Nager.Date**

- License: MIT License
- Notes: The API and its source code are licensed under the MIT License. No authentication is required for the public API.
Offline or commercial usage (e.g., via Docker or NuGet packages) may be subject to separate licensing, but this does not affect the MIT licensing of the open source API.


As per the maintainers of both APIs, **no attribution is required** for using or distributing the data.  
However, we recommend reviewing the official documentation and usage terms on their respective websites to ensure proper understanding and responsible use.
